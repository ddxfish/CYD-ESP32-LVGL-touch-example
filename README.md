# CYD-ESP32-LVGL-touch-example
Example code for the ESP32 dev board known as the CYD or Cheap Yellow Display. AKA ESP32-2432S028, ESP32-2432S024R


This project is a demo. It's for beginners with the cheap yellow display. It's everything on the CYD working except the speaker. The light sensor on mine always returned zero but I suspect the code was correct. 

## Software and Libraries Used

LVGL: An open-source graphics library for creating embedded GUIs.
TFT_eSPI: A graphics library for ESP8266 and ESP32 that supports different TFT displays.
XPT2046_Bitbang: A library for interfacing with XPT2046 resistive touch controllers using bit-banging for SPI communication.
Arduino IDE or PlatformIO: Development platforms used for writing, compiling, and uploading the code to ESP32.
